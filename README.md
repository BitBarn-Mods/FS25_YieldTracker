# YieldTracker

> ⚠️ **Note:** This mod currently supports **Singleplayer** mode only on **PC/Mac**.

**YieldTracker** helps you keep track of your harvests across different fields and years in Farming Simulator. It logs total yields by **crop (fill type)**, **field number**, and **year**, so you can easily monitor your farm’s performance over time.

Whether you're managing fields on your own or working with **AI workers** or **contract jobs**, YieldTracker automatically records your results for later review.
